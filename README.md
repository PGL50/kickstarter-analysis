# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### This project had two purposes: 1. To gain more experience with Excel and 2. To analyse the Kickstarter data to give ficticious Louise some insight for her play based on the launch data and funding goals. The analyses looked specifically at the Theater parent category and the plays sub-category.

## Analysis and Challenges

### The first part of the analysis was looking at the number of outcomes vs the launch month. Live outcomes were excluded. The data were summarized in a pivot table to filter for Theater outcomes only. From the pivot table, a line chart was created to look at the relationship of the number of the three outcomes by their launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
####  There is a peak of successful campaigns in the months of May-July. After that the number of succesful outcomes has a declining trend into December. Failed ooutcomes also peak in the months of May-August, around 50 per month. The number of canceled outcomes does not seem to have any relationship to the month in which it was launched.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The number of succesful Theater outcomes is higher in the Launch months of May, June, and July (highest in May)
1. From May to December there is a pretty strong negative trend where number of sucessful outcomes goes down.
1. The number of canceled outcomes doesn't seem to matter which month they were launched.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The percentage of successful outcomes for plays goes down (from ~80% to 20%) as the goal goes up until a blip at 35,000 to 44,999. At thost goals the percent succesful jumps up to almost 70%.
2. There were no canceled plays at any goal level.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
